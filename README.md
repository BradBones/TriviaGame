# Trivia Game

## An Alien movie themed multiple choice quiz.

*I chose to recreate the feel of the 1979 vision-of-the-future computer (MU/TH/UR) interface from the movie for a nostalgic retro vibe.*

**This app was coded using:**

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* jQuery


**Things I'd like to add to this project:**

* A "try Again" button that does something more dynamic than just refresh the browser.
* More text animation with a more complex setup of IDs and Classes.
* A function to test whether the user's score = 100% and reveal an easter egg if so.
